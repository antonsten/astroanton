<p>Just like </p>
<a href="https://www.antonsten.com/2017">last year</a>
 , I wanted to end the year by reflecting on what has passed. 2018 has been a very different year, both for my business and for me personally. There‚Äôs been a lot of growth and change, but not exactly in the way I would have imagined at the beginning of 2018.</p>

<p>At the end of 2017 I was working with Thinkable in Stockholm as an acting UX Lead for one of their bigger clients, Apotek Hj√§rtat. During that fall, I had this bad feeling in my stomach, that perhaps not everything was as it should be. Invoices started to pile up and finally in January, I discovered that the agency was, in fact, bankrupt. It ended up being quite a costly lesson for me as I lost more than 0,000 in unpaid invoices.</p>
<p>In April of 2018, I found out that because of an internal reorganization, my longest standing client, </p>
<a href="https://www.antonsten.com/eon">E.ON</a>
 was forced to have all their digital assignments done by their parent agency, KAN - ending our partnership after working together for 4 years. I‚Äôm really proud of the work we‚Äôve done during these years and the people I worked with are some of the nicest people. I‚Äôm sincerely hoping that our paths will cross again at some point!</p>
<p>The lesson with both Thinkable and E.ON though is that even though the product may no longer be ‚Äòcool‚Äô, it‚Äôs really all about the people you work with and the team at E.ON and Patrik and Ninna from Thinkable will always have a very special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>The spring was not just bad news though! I worked closely with the team at </p>
<a href="https://www.antonsten.com/ne">Nationalencyklopedin</a>
 to revise their visual identity and create a robust 
<a href="https://www.antonsten.com/designsystem">design system</a>
 for them. It was one of the first large scale design systems I‚Äôve created so it was a great experience to see that come to life.</p>
<p>In May I was approached by an old client. However, it was not an ordinary website project. Without going into much detail, they are developing a sourcing and supplier tool for their internal use. It‚Äôs one of the largest digital projects within the company and to be able to work on a B2B platform of this scale is something completely different to what I‚Äôve ever done before.</p>
<p>So since June, I‚Äôve been working as their UX Specialist / Lead to ensure the best possible user experience for co-workers and suppliers. I‚Äôm excited by the work we‚Äôre doing and happy to continue it well into 2019. It IS a huge change though from work I‚Äôve previously done. I spend 90% of my time in Powerpoint, Excel, and meetings. I‚Äôll try to write more about my experiences from working within a large organization at some point too.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also continued to work with the great teams at </p>
<a href="https://www.lysa.nu/?ref="antonsten".com">Lysa</a>
 , 
<a href="https://www.antonsten.com/falkenberg">Falkenberg</a>
 and I was in charge of the User Experience module at

 this year.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been continuing to practice Pilates at least on a weekly basis and I definitely feel that my body is in better shape. For people like me who sit in-front of a computer most of the day, that kind of workout is so rewarding!</p>
<p>The usually warm and long summer here in Sweden meant I finally tried SUP boarding and I got hooked immediately! It‚Äôs such a great exercise form - both for body and mind! Getting out paddling after a long day in meetings is the best form of rehabilitation I‚Äôve ever experienced. I highly recommend everyone to try it! Extra bonus points that my wife got equally excited so it meant we had a sport and an activity that we could share!</p>

</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to 2019 in a way I‚Äôve not experienced in some time. I‚Äôm doing some personal development as well that I‚Äôve started to see some results from so I‚Äôm curious to how that will pan out.</p>
<p>Either way, I‚Äôll continue to share my thoughts here throughout 2019 and I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing the year with you.</p>
