MVP is a term that gets thrown around a lot in the startup world. But what does it really mean? And more importantly, how do you know if your product is truly minimum AND viable?

The key is to focus on the core functionalities that solve your users' most pressing problems. Don't get caught up in adding features that might be nice to have but aren't essential to the core value proposition.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Build your MVP with the absolute minimum features needed to solve the core problem
2. Execute it with real users and gather feedback
3. Learn from user interactions and iterate based on their needs

Remember: The goal is to validate your assumptions and learn from real user feedback, not to build a perfect product right out of the gate.

So, before you add that next feature, ask yourself: "Is this really necessary for the MVP?" If not, save it for later iterations.
