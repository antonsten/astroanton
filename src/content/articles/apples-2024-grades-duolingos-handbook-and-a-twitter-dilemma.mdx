<p>Hi,</p>
<p>How's 2025 treating you? I think the world is crazier than ever, and perhaps the most terrifying thing is that we're getting more and more accustomed to it. I was talking to a friend the other day about Twitter/X and whether we should still use it. About a year ago, when Walt Mossberg left Twitter, he explained his departure by saying he "doesn't hang out in Nazi bars." What was somewhat true then, and still enjoyable, isn't fun anymore. There's no denying Elon Musk is a right-wing fascist, and by using Twitter, we're ultimately supporting him. My friend claimed he's "not making political judgment calls" â€” which I think is how many of us rationalize it. But the reality is that boycotting Elon Musk isn't merely political; it's the humane thing to do.</p>
<p>Although I'm no longer using Twitter, I find it hard to completely let go and delete my account. I still check in about once a month, making me what's known in tech as a MAU (Monthly Active User) â€” one of their key metrics. I talk the talk, but I have to admit that I'm not walking the walk here. What about you?</p>

<p>I just discovered that in Apple Notes (which is probably capable enough for most of us), you can type "&gt;&gt;" inside a note to automatically link to another note. Mind. Blown.</p>

<p>If I were to list 5 companies that Iâ€™d one day would love to work for, Duolingo would probably make the to 5. Iâ€™m such awe of what theyâ€™ve done with their brand, how they kept the product focused but still always interesting. Loved reading their company handbook!</p>

<p>John Gruber is one of my favorite writers and has been for years. His analysis of not just Apple but the tech industry in general is always thoughtful and insightful. I completely agree with his 2024 Apple Report Card: "I didn't realize this as I was writing my report card, but each of my grades that changed from last year was </p>
<em>lower</em>
 . Not one grade went up. Thinking about that as I write this preamble today, it feels correct: there are several areas where Apple maintained consistent excellence in 2024, but I can't think of a single area where Apple leveled up. Not one. That feels like a problem."</p>

<p>Finally, I have two links to share from Henrik Werdelin (founder of BARK). His latest Substack is packed with great advice, and rather than excerpt pieces, I encourage you to read the whole thing. If you're short on time though, his 8+1 Framework is particularly intriguing.</p>
