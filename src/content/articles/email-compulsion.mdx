<p>I’ve been checking my personal emails 3 times a day or less for the last 2 months, and it’s had a noticeable effect on my mood, happiness and self-esteem. </p>

<br> Your compulsion of choice might be Twitter, Instagram, or Reddit. Whatever it is, you might be a bit happier if you used it a bit less, so here are the habits and thought patterns that helped me with my emails.

<br> Between 2013 and a few months ago, I had an email-hungry gorilla on my back. She was always demanding to know whether any long-lost friends, reporters (it happened once, it could happen again), or well-wishers had gotten in touch during the last few minutes. I also had a vague and mounting sense of wanting to check my emails less. Every time I did open my inbox I felt like I had failed at something, and had given in to my cravings and my gorilla. Whenever I even considered checking my emails I felt a duty to try to resist. Then I either spent some willpower, which we’re assuming is a finite resource, or gave in and felt like a gross loser.

 {:target=”_blank”} 
<p>I can relate to this on a number of levels. I once got an email from the design/HR team at Apple and since then, deep down inside, I'm expecting something similar to happen again. Also, I feel ashamed when I sometimes check my email on my phone and before it moves into "Checking email...", I have time to read "Last updated: 4 mins ago".</p>
