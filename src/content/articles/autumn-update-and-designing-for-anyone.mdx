<p>How have you been? I'm doing great! I spent last weekend strolling the streets of Paris with Anna, indulging in delicious food for three days. To be honest, I'm also not minding that autumn is rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>I promised you this post weeks ago, but I wasn't able to finish it until just 15 minutes ago. I struggled a bit with framing it without sounding like I don't care about accessible design (I do!) while also admitting that for many designers‚Äîyours truly included‚Äîit's not always "top of mind" when designing (though it should be).</p>
<p>A recent article by Cat Noone changed my perspective on accessible design. Her insight? Accessible design isn't about designing for everyone; it's about designing for anyone. Simple, yet so powerful!</p>
