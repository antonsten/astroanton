<p>Happy Saturday,</p>
<p>I hope you're spending the day doing something you love. I spent last week in Marrakech celebrating my 44th trip around the sun. It was my first visit to Morocco, and I absolutely loved it‚Äîwonderful food, abundant sunshine, and incredibly friendly people.</p>
<p>Just before I left, I was honored to be invited back to Ivey Business School to talk about product design and the shared process between creating physical and digital products. Translating a talk into a blog post is always tricky, but I think this ended up quite well. </p>
