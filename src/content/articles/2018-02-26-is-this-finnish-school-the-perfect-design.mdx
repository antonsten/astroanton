>Ms Grahn-Laasonen said: <i>“Schools can choose a theme like climate change and you can look at it from very different perspectives, from very different subjects like mathematics … It's giving our children skills to think about subjects like climate change from different perspectives.”</i><br />Proponents of PBL say it helps to equip students with the critical thinking skills they need to flourish today. Kirsti Lonka, a professor of educational psychology at Helsinki University, told the BBC: <i>“When it comes to real life, our brain is not sliced into disciplines ... we are thinking in a very holistic way. And when you think about the problems in the world – global crises, migration, the economy, the post-truth era – we really haven’t given our children the tools to deal with this inter-cultural world.”</i>**<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/why-finland-is-tearing-down-walls-in-schools/">Is this Finnish school the perfect design?</a>**
