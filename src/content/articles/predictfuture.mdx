<p>What you do today does impact your future. </p>
<br>
<br> Do you eat junk food? </br>
<br> I’ll tell you this: In 10 years you’ll be fatter and unhealthier. 
<br>
</br>
<br>
<br> Do you complain? </br>
<br> I’ll tell you this: Your life’s situation will be exactly the same in 10 years. 
<br>
</br>
<br>
<br> Do you lounge in your office chair all day and watch YouTube videos instead of doing hard things? </br>
<br> I’ll tell you this: You’ll be stuck at that same job. Or worse, you’ll get fired. 
<br>
</br>
<br>
<br> Do you spend more than you earn? </br>
<br> I’ll tell you this: In 10 years, you’ll worry about money every single day. 
<br>

<br> Obviously, I’m not a fortune teller. But this predicting is easy. Anyone with a little common sense can do it. And it works like a charm. </br>
