There&#8217;s a great post over at boagworld called <a href="https://boagworld.com/usability/user-experience-design-is-not-what-you-think/" target="_blank">User Experience Design is not what you think</a>. I was particularly fascinated by the following:

I have honestly no idea how this is done technically but it&#8217;s inspiring to think about the amount of technical work that have been done behind the scenes to be able to create something as &#8220;shallow&#8221; as not having the say your pin code when you dial in. It really goes to show that it&#8217;s the small things that create an amazing experience. Well done Barclays for investing the time in creating a great seamless user experience.
