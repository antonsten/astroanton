Thought this was a great post from <a href="https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/user-is-the-king-part-2-af6edf9b11dc" target="_blank">Benjamin Burger</a> on how to build great user experiences.

While the entire post is read-worthy for anyone even remotely interested in building digital experiences, there&#8217;s one passage where I think Benjamin really nails it:

> The best way for it to be downloaded, is to be shared;<br>
The best way for it to be shared, is to be used;<br>
The best way for it to be used is to have a proper onboarding, explaining clearly how to use it and why I will use it.

It&#8217;s so often that we focus on the wrong things, assuming that the user is overly interested in our product and willing to spend minutes just &#8220;trying&#8221; our app out when in reality we&#8217;ll be happy to get a more than 10 seconds. With a complicated sign up/sign in process, we won&#8217;t even get that much.
