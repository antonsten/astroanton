<p>I can highly relate to what Ethan Marcotte is describing. I've worked with teams that refer to visual design as 'wireframes'. I'm especially intrigued by the final part of his piece:</p>

<p>But in addition to that, these workshop teams gradually realize the primary benefit to creating a pattern library isn’t the patterns themselves. Don’t get me wrong: identifying strong, sustainable patterns is, y’know, why we do this work. But rather, they understand the language used to name, organize, and find their patterns is what allows them to use those patterns effectively—and that is what creates more consistent designs. </p>

<p>Would love to run something like this with clients.</p>
