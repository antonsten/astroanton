Great piece of thinking on what AR would mean for ordinary people in a not too distant future (say, October 2017?) by <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1974">Luke Wroblewski</a>.

>I drafted a series of illustrations on "what would augment reality?". For each illustration I assumed audio input control and gaze path/eye-tracking for object identification. Due to these assumptions, I specifically tried to apply a principle of maximum information yet minimum obstruction (MIMO) to the user interface design.

My high-level goal, however, was to literally "augment" reality. That is, to give people abilities they wouldn't otherwise have through the inclusion of digital information and actions in the physical world.
