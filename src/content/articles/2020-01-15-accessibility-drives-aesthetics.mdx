>Oftentimes, ableist people use this as an excuse to avoid designing for disabled people. Thatâ€™s not what this rule is actually about. This rule is intended to focus on the most common user goals and scenarios. Take a pet supply online store, for example. If 80% of people want to buy pet food, we can de-prioritize the case where 20% of people want a treat tasting subscription service. But people should be able to buy pet food whether they are Blind, or Deaf, or have cerebral palsy, or have any kind of disability that requires accessibility.<br /><br />
Edge cases refer to scenarios, not humans.**<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/accessibility-drives-aesthetics-5aef77b5d2aa">Accessibility drives aesthetics</a>**
