<p>Clip sharing of podcasts is something that's been on my wishlist for a long long time, so I was extremely happy to read about this update from <a href="https://marco.org/2019/04/27/overcast-clip-sharing?ref=antonsten.com">Overcast</a>. From a user experience perspective, I really enjoyed the simple sharing process and as podcasts have started to get longer and longer (many up to two hours), it's asking a lot of someone to say "you should listen to this episode" when most of the times, it's a specific clip you want them to listen to.</p>
<p>Secondly, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510897/luminary-podcast-app-launch-the-daily-gimlet-media-spotify?ref=antonsten.com">actions are put in motion</a> to limit the availability and freedom that we've always enjoyed from podcasts, I think this is a way in the opposite direction which I fully support. Thank you <a href="https://marco.org/?ref=antonsten.com">Marco</a>.</p>
