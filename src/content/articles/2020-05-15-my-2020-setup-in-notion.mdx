>If you know me, even in the slightest, you’re probably aware of just how much I love the note-taking tool Notion, likely because I talk about it far too often. I’ve used it to track each and every day of my life for the past three years; positive events, negative events, exercise, daily goals, caffeine, alcohol, and more. It’s all there.
