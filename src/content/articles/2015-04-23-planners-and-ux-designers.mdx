> &#8220;The two minds—the experience designer and the planner—are so important because as I look for pain points and things that will add value over time, the planners look for dissonance and interesting elements that will stand out. By combining these two mind-sets, we&#8217;re looking for patterns and dissonance together. It gets really juicy and really interesting.&#8221;

I do share her reasoning that different types of people (roles) will look for different solutions and pain points. Different perspectives on the same problem should ideally give a more thought through solution.

However, I think it&#8217;s clear from the quote that R/GA&#8217;s blood is marketing rather than product design.

From a product design perspective I&#8217;m trying to create an experience without elements that stand out but rather a seamless, simple and efficient solution. People that use products daily want things that just work &#8211; not things that stand out and create fraction against the rest of the experience.
