Here's a couple of random things that I've been thinking about lately:

Often when I talk to businesses, I highlight the importance of focus. However, when looking at my own business I can see how easy it is to become influenced through what *everyone else is doing*. It can be a good thing (like when I decided to [write a book](/books/) because I had enjoyed the books [Paul Jarvis](https://pjrvs.com) had written and self-published), but then there are cases when looking too hard at other's accomplishments can guide you away from your true passion. For example, I thought a while ago that along with my consulting and blog writing I should also sell products. In order to sell these products, I needed other things to support them like [free email courses](/uxcourse/) which then needed fancy email marketing tools where you can do automations and segmenting and sequencing and... phew. Just like that, having a simple course to share knowledge became a part-time job.

Almost [exactly a year ago](/break/) I was in a similar position and decided that [taking a break](/break/) was my best choice. Today I think it's time to rethink the purpose of all of this. I've already started the process of moving my newsletter from Convertkit to a free service with far less features, [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/). Much like when mobile phones turned into smartphones, I'm struggling to use just the basics. One perk of this move is that there's finally an option to [archive (almost) all of my past newsletters](https://buttondown.email/antonsten/archive/)! Here's what [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com) said when I asked him about Buttondown:

> Itâ€™s straight-up: type some markup and email it to people, which is what I need. Mailchimp was overkill.

So you can expect less A/B-tested subject lines sent on optimal times tailored directly to your preferences and more of these personal updates. Instead, I'll opt-in to the fact that [I'm professional because I'm personal](/i-am-professional-because-i-am-personal/) - something I wrote nearly four years ago and is still true today.

I want the newsletter, and my business, to be more personal. Less 'push' and more 'dialogue'.
