>Here’s the thing: Zoom doesn’t need to be in the advertising business, least of all in the part of it that lives like a vampire off the blood of human data. If Zoom needs more money, it should charge more for its services, or give less away for free. Zoom has an extremely valuable service, which it performs very well — better than anybody else, apparently. It also has a platform with lots of apps with just as absolute an interest in privacy.**<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/03/regarding_zoom">Regarding Zoom</a>**

I use Zoom on a daily basis and I love it. Their technology is so much better than Hangouts or even worse, Teams. But this entire article is concerning to say the least. I get that some apps rely on advertising revenue but Zoom charges most of their users money - good money even.
