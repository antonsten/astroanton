>Fortunately, UX (User eXperience) designers have found ways to design beautiful interfaces that are easy to use. Their process can resemble a philosophical enquiry, where they constantly asks questions such as: What is this really about? How do we perceive this? What is our mental model?<br /><br />Today, as a result of their efforts, we interact with wonderfully designed interfaces. Designers have been taming complexity for us. They make extremely sophisticated technology appear simple and easy to use.<br /><br />
But we don’t see — let alone understand — what is going on behind the scenes, behind the simple appearance. We are kept in the dark.<br /><br />

We fail to appreciate and to empathise because we don’t understand what is going on.<br /><br />
