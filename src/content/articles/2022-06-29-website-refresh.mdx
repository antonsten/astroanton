Hi,
How are you? I'm doing well. I had completely forgotten (repressed?) how much work it is to have a puppy, but it's a lot of fun, and I'm blessed to be able to work less these first weeks to make sure she settles in well.

[Having the luxury of working from your backyard](https://twitter.com/antonsten/status/1542061590480130053?s=20&t=jaxp_Mh53uq-_nNfnEI7cQ) is something I value.

I'm not playing catch all day long, though; I am still very much working with Titan - and - I've made some significant updates to my website. So let's quickly walk through some of the updates:

1. [The work section is back!](/work) While the information about each project is brief, I wanted to give you a better understanding of the work I've done these last years and the breadth of clients. It includes work with amazing clients such as Titan, Google, Delio, and many more.

2. There are a [couple of new testimonials,](/testimonials) including one from Nicole Hampton. Nicole and I first met while working on HermanMiller, we reconnected at Ueno, and finally, we were both in management roles at Product. She is by far one of my favorite collaborators and persons.

3. There is a [new Coaching page,](/coaching) including a testimonial from Brian, who has been using my coaching service weekly for a year. I have a few open slots starting mid-August.

4. It has, not much, but at least some, color.

The Slack community is growing and evolving to just the kind of community I had hoped to build. For example, just the other day, a member shared challenges about a founder who was micro-managing the design process and pixel-pushing design details. Within hours, she had a ton of great replies and solutions for how to best tackle the situation. Anyone [subscribed to the newsletter](/newsletter) can join!

I'm taking some time off to recharge from mid-July until the beginning of August. But come August, I have some availability to take on a smaller project, so if you have anything that might use an extra pair of hands (or eyes), [don't be a stranger.](/contact)

Enjoy your summer ðŸ˜Ž
