>“We focused too much on what we wanted to bring to the world. We needed to pay attention to what the world wanted from us.” **[Ivan Zhao, Co-founder of Notion](https://usefyi.com/notion-history/)**

It's a [fascinating post](https://usefyi.com/notion-history/) about the early days of Notion, [a tool](https://www.notion.so/?r=a3b4edc52f61492aab6c770f4c9f8dbf) I've started to become far more dependable on and really love it's flexibility. I like the above quote from Ivan, however later in the post, he says something that I think is contradicting to the above statement:

>“The market is huge — everyone with a computer.”**[Ivan Zhao, Co-founder of Notion](https://usefyi.com/notion-history/)**

The market is everyone that has a need for a tool like Notion. My wife has a computer but would never use a tool like Notion, nor would my dad. The ultra corporate people all have computers, most of them will most likely never adopt a tool like Notion. To say that their market is everyone with a computer is like saying that Porsche's market is everyone that needs to be transported from A to B.
