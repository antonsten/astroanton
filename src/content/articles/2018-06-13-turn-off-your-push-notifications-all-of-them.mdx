>Over the last few years, there's been an increasingly loud call for a re-evaluation of the relationship between humans and smartphones. For all the good that phones do, their grip on our eyes, ears, and thoughts creates real and serious problems. "I know when I take [technology] away from my kids what happens,” Tony Fadell said in a recent interview. “They literally feel like you're tearing a piece of their person away from them.

I have badges for Twitter, Linkedin and the App Store.
