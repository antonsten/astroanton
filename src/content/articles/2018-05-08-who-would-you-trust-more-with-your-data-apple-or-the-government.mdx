>The theory is that one highly-protected database could be safer than having our personal data scattered throughout thousands of different databases.

The question is who could be trusted to be the central repository for personal data? The piece suggests that governments, Google, Amazon and Apple could all be candidates.**<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/07/privacy-poll-apple-government/">Who would you trust more with your data, Apple or the government?</a>**

It's an interesting topic and one that I think we should have a more open and serious discussion about. Given that the poll is on 9to5Apple, a website that mainly attracts Apple supporters, the results are biased but it's still interesting that Apple scores 87% of the votes while the government is below 3%, ahead of Google (1.6%) and Amazon (0.5%). I'm not even sure the people that voted for Amazon are serious, if they are I would love to hear their argument.

I have no doubts that neither Apple nor the government would ever sell my data so for me it's merely a case of who I think would have better security measurements in place. iCloud was hacked years ago but so has most governments. With Google and Amazon, I'm 100% confident that they would sell the data, or at least misuse it.
