<p>That doesn’t mean that everyone actually makes wireframes, but when someone admits they don’t it’s often in a hushed tone and without a lot of eye contact. They would like to include them. It’s just that the constraints of their organization, stakeholders, or project prevent it from always being possible. But the mindset that they are essential, and many beliefs about their advantages may be misguided. While I won’t deny that wireframes are ever useful, nowadays they’re valuable only in limited circumstances that are narrowing by the day. There are a number of shifts in industry thinking and practices that are contributing to this change and are worth examining. </p>

<p>Completely agree, it's far less common for me to make wireframes these days and in many cases when I do, I question the reason. They </p>
<em>can</em>
 serve a purpose but just like anything else, it's unreasonable to think they 
<em>always</e>
</em>
 do.</p>
