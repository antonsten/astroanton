What they meant by this is that I should go away and write a humble list of priorities for every project: most important info at the top -> least important info at the bottom. So instead of trying to figure out the order of the information in a component—like a card or a table or what have you, we should use this content audit to help define the visual priority of each bit.**<a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/dont-draw-the-ui-draw-the-priority">Don’t draw the UI, draw the priority</a>**
