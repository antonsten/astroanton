<p>The best business advice we ever got is from Jeff Bezos from Amazon.com (Jeff bought a small piece of our company in 2006). He told us "Find the things that won't change in your business and invest heavily in those things."</p>

<p>He explained it like this… "Take Amazon for example… 10 years from now people aren't going to say 'I wish Amazon shipping was slower' or 'I wish Amazon had a worse selection', so we invest heavily in fast shipping and a broad selection."</p>

<p>So what are those things for us? 10 years from now people aren't going to say "I wish Basecamp was harder to use" or "I wish Basecamp was slower and less reliable" or "I wish it took longer to get an answer from someone at Basecamp", so we invest heavily in infrastructure, great design, and customer service. <a href="https://basecamp.com/about?ref=antonsten.com" target="_blank">Read more at Basecamp</a></p>
