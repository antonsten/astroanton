To look at UX as something that simply reduces friction is one way but it's also a very short-sighted way. UX should be long-term and a great long-term user experience can weigh in the extra seconds it takes to add a layer of security even if it's slightly inconvenient when setting up. A great UX writer will help you describe for the user _why_ it requires 2FA (or something else) and the user benefits.

>We could chalk this up to lazy journalism but in fact the fault lies with us, with designers who have utterly failed at explaining what it is that we do to the world at large. There is little comprehension of what design does or how to define user experience, and what possibilities exist within these broad, amorphous concepts for everyday people. **<a href="https://www.subtraction.com/2019/04/24/scapegoating-ux-design/">Scapegoating User Experience Design</a>**
