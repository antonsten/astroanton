>This post was originally titled “simplicity is a battle”, but it dawned on us that that’s not strictly true – battles can be lost, while a war can still be won. Similarly, you can win battles while still losing a war. Simplicity is a war because it’s eroded in small battles that occur daily, often faster than the blink of an eye. You can win many battles for simplicity, but still end up with a complex product or company.

Simplicity is a war. And it’s being lost with thousands of tiny battles.**[Simplicity is a war](https://www.gosquared.com/blog/simplicity)**

[Great post](https://www.gosquared.com/blog/simplicity) by James, made me think of an old post of mine that, for an unknown reason, has been getting some significant organic traffic - [Why simple is hard](/simple-is-hard).
