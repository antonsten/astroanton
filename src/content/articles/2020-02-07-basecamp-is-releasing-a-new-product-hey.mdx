Aren't we all? It is indeed pay. I mean, all services are. We just accept the payment in cash money, whereas so many others take their payment in privacy violations or attention hoarding.**<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/dhh/status/1225487645268160512">@dhh on twitter</a>**

Basecamp is releasing their first new product in years, <a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a> and I'm very excited about it. I've been looking at options to move away from Google for years and this could be it. Loved the above response from @DHH in his Twitter thread.
