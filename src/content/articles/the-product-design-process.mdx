<p>I was recently invited back to Ivey Business School to talk about the Product Design Process. I guess it's a good sign if you're invited back to do the same lecture once again, still, I can never shake the feeling of being way out of my depth when talking to a room full of really smart and bright people. But I guess it's true what they say — when you're way out of your comfort zone, that's when you're on the right path. I wanted to share a version of my talk online, even though transforming a talk to a blog post is never the same thing, especially this one as it lacks the thoughtful and engaged discussion I had with the students.</p>

<p>Product design isn't just about making things pretty. It's about making them work well for real people. It's about identifying problems, ideating solutions, and packaging it in something that's not just helpful, but joyful. Today, I'll walk you through the core of product design, where AI fits in, and how we make design decisions that actually improve lives.</p>
<p>What does product design mean to you? If someone tells you they work with product design, what do you think they do? When we talk about product design, many think about physical objects. But in an increasingly digital world, you'll see that physical and digital products share the same creation process. Over the coming hour, we'll look more closely at the work we do as product designers and how much it shares with other principles of design.</p>

<div>“When you see an object, you may so many assumptions about an object. What it does, how well it's going to do it, how much you think it should cost.”

<li>Functional – The product must work.

<li>Reliable – Users need to feel safe and secure, especially in industries like banking.</li>
<li>Usable – Navigation must be intuitive, and everything should work as expected. </li>

<li>Pleasurable – The experience should be enjoyable, setting a new standard. </li>

<div>“Bullsh*t. Look around you. You make choices based on design every day. 
<br>
</br>
<br>Even if you can’t design those things yourself, that doesn’t take away from your ability to decide that was the chair you wanted to sit on, or the shoes you wanted to wear, or the car you wanted to buy. 
<br>
</br>
<br>You know bad design when you encounter it. From every chair you’ve sat in that hurt your ass, to every coffee cup that burned your hand, to every time your finger triggered the wrong link on your phone, to every airline booking site that pissed you off. You know bad design. You hate it.”

<h3 id="key-takeaways-1">Key takeaways</h>
</h3>
<ol>
</ol>
<li>Design influences decisions – Whether we realize it or not, design impacts every choice we make. You don’t need to be a designer to recognize bad design – Everyone has experienced frustrating design, whether it’s a bad chair, a confusing interface, or a terrible airline website.</li>
<li>Usability matters because bad design creates frustration – A product can be functional, but if it’s difficult or unpleasant to use, people will avoid it. Great UX isn’t just nice to have—it’s expected – Users don’t tolerate bad design, and businesses that ignore usability will lose to those who prioritize it. </li>

<h2 id="visual-design">Visual Design</h>
</h2>
<p>Good design isn’t just about making things look nice—it’s about making them work better. A well-designed interface guides users, reduces confusion, and makes interactions feel effortless.</p>
<strong>Good design isn’t decoration—it’s clarity. 
<h3 id="key-principles-of-visual-design">Key Principles of Visual Design</h>
</h3>
<ol>
</ol>
<li>Hierarchy – Directing Attention - Good design helps users focus on what matters. Think of a landing page—what’s the first thing you notice? A headline? A call-to-action button? That’s because designers use size, color, and spacing to create 
<em>visual hierarchy</e>
</em>
 . Without it, everything competes for attention, and the user doesn’t know where to go next.</li>
<li>Consistency – Making Things Feel Familiar - Our brains love patterns. When buttons, menus, and layouts follow consistent rules, users don’t have to </li>
<em>think</em>
 —they just know what to do. Imagine if every app had a different way to close a window. You’d go crazy! Consistency builds trust and makes interfaces feel intuitive.</li>
<li>Typography &amp; Color – More Than Just Style - Typography and color aren’t just about aesthetics; they directly impact usability. Ever tried reading light gray text on a white background? It’s painful. High contrast improves readability, and font choices can change how a product feels. A financial app might use a bold, trustworthy font, while a meditation app might go for something soft and friendly.</l>
</li>
<li>Simplicity – Less is More - One of the biggest mistakes in design is trying to </li>
<em>add</em>
 more instead of simplifying. Every element on the screen should serve a purpose. Apple is a great example—think of their product pages. No distractions, no clutter, just clear messaging and intuitive navigation. Simple doesn’t mean boring; it means 
<em>clear</e>
</em>
 . 
<p>Good design isn’t about decoration—it’s about clarity. When a product is visually well-designed, users don’t have to struggle to use it, they just </p>
<em>get it</em>
 .</p>

</ul>
<li>Visual Electric - I use Visual Electric to prompt for images that are impossible to find among stock libraries, like crying babies or a child with a rash (not to mention families that aren’t white middle class…)</li>
<li>Stark - I use Stark to check design for color contrast and accessibility. </li>
<h3 id="key-takeaways-2">Key takeaways</h3>
<p>As we’ve seen, visual design is not just about aesthetics—it’s about function, clarity, and guiding the user experience. But that doesn’t mean beauty doesn’t matter. In fact, great design balances </p>
<strong>usability and aesthetics</strong>
 . Not balance because it's suggesting there's trade-off, but a great play between the two.</p>
<p>That’s why I love this quote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
</div>
<div>“Don’t make something unless it is both necessary and useful; but if it is both necessary and useful, don’t hesitate to make it beautiful.” 
<br>
</br>
<em>Joshua Porter </div>
<p>Great design is not just about what a product does, but how it makes people </p>
<em>feel</em>
 . If we can create something functional, reliable, and easy to use—why not make it beautiful too?</p>
<h2 id="prototyping-and-iteration">Prototyping and iteration</h>
</h2>
<p>One of the biggest differences between physical and digital products is how they evolve over time. Physical products are locked in once they’re manufactured—if there’s a flaw, fixing it means going back through the supply chain, redesigning parts, and waiting months before customers see an improvement.</p>
<p>This agility allows for continuous refinement—testing, learning, and improving over time. Instead of aiming for perfection before launch, great digital products embrace iteration, ensuring they stay relevant and meet user expectations.</p>
<p>Digital products? Completely different story.</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<li>Digital Products Are Built to Evolve - In the digital world, we can iterate fast. If a feature isn’t working, we tweak it. If users are struggling, we refine the design. This ability to make quick updates means that digital products aren’t just 
<em>launched</e>
</em>
 —they’re constantly 
<em>evolving</e>
</em>
 .</li>
<li>Speed Matters – Learn &amp; Adapt Quickly - Companies that embrace fast iteration have a huge advantage. They don’t wait for the ‘perfect’ product; they test, release, gather feedback, and improve. Think about apps like Instagram or Spotify—do you remember their first versions? Probably not, because they’ve evolved so much through continuous updates and user feedback.</l>
</li>
<li>Iteration vs. Perfection - Too many teams get stuck trying to make something perfect before launch. But perfection is a moving target—what works today might not work tomorrow. Instead, the best digital products focus on learning, adapting, and improving over time. </li>
<p>The real power of digital products isn’t just that they 
<em>can</e>
</em>
 change—it’s that they 
<em>must</e>
</em>
 change to stay relevant. The best products are never truly finished.</p>
<h3 id="here%E2%80%99s-how-i-use-ai-for-prototyping-and-iteration">Here’s how I use AI for Prototyping and Iteration</h>
</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<li>Lovable, Replit and V0 - I use tools like lovable, Replit and V0 to build actual prototypes quickly which are much more useful than static screens or Figma prototypes when getting feedback. 
<div class="blockquote">
</div>
<div>“I also make a point to regularly speak with customers. This is something a lot of people shy away from, because it’s uncomfortable. 
<br>
</br>
<br>This is something I remember learning from Ryan Delk years ago. He’d meet people who said they used his product, and he’d say, “That’s amazing,” but then immediately follow with: “What could we do better?” 
<br>
</br>
<br>It’s such a simple question, but a scary one. Most people would rather ask what someone loves about their product because it feels good, and it’s less painful.”

</h3>
<p>As we’ve discussed, digital products have the unique advantage of being able to evolve. But to improve, we need one critical thing— </p>
<strong>real feedback. 
<p>Yet, many teams shy away from it. They’d rather hear what people </p>
<em>love</em>
 about their product than face the hard truth of what’s 
<em>not working</e>
</em>
 . But the best products don’t come from avoiding discomfort—they come from embracing it.</p>
<p>The best teams don’t just listen to feedback—they </p>
<em>seek it out</em>
 . They don’t wait for problems to show up—they go looking for them. Because every great product is built, not in isolation, but in constant conversation with its users.</p>
<h2 id="tying-it-all-together">Tying It All Together</h>
</h2>
<p>So, what makes a great digital product? It’s not just about having a good idea, or even strong execution. It’s about constantly learning, improving, and evolving. Let’s go over the key takeaways one last time.</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<li>Understand Your Users – Research, Don’t Assume - We started with user research because it’s the foundation of everything. The biggest mistake teams make is assuming they already know what users need. But the best products don’t come from guessing—they come from listening.</li>
<li>Design for Usability – Functionality First, But Make It Intuitive - A product isn’t great if people struggle to use it. Functionality is the starting point, but usability is what makes it successful. No one wants to fight with an interface just to complete a simple task.</l>
</li>
<li>Make It Visually Clear – Design Guides Users, Not Just Decorates - Visual design isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about communication. A well-designed product removes confusion, builds trust, and makes interactions feel effortless. It’s not about making things ‘pretty’—it’s about making them clear.</l>
</li>
<li>Iterate &amp; Improve – The Best Products Evolve With Feedback - The best digital products aren’t built in one go. They launch, they gather feedback, and they improve over time. The biggest difference between a mediocre product and a great one is the willingness to keep refining. </li>
<p>At the end of the day, great products aren’t built in isolation. They don’t come from just one person’s vision—they’re shaped by real users, continuous learning, and thoughtful design. And the teams that embrace this mindset? They’re the ones that build products people love.</p>
