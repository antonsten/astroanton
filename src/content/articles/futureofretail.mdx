<p>For more than 10,000 years stores have played a significant role in the formation of our cities. They built around town squares and have historically acted as meeting spots providing culture and community.</p>

<p>The Internet is changing this behavior. First, retail stores moved away from town centers and out to suburban malls, disconnecting from the city center. Later, as online buying became more and more popular, these same stores started really struggling with diminishing sales. The first real casualty of online shopping was when music stores began to disappear. Ask yourself, when was the last time you were in a record store with CDs? This trend is bound to continue as more diverse products (clothing, medications, home goods) are being offered by the online giants. Brick and mortar stores are being forced to innovate or die. Even fresh food is openly available to be purchased online and delivered to your doorstep in larger cities!</p>

<p>Jack Ma, founder of legendary Alibaba coined the expression 'New Retail' as the next evolution of the retail space. He said he believes the future of physical stores will have to use the advantages of an online store in a physical location in order to survive. </p>

<p>Retail locations will need to give their customers a stronger incentive for a visit. Sales and lower prices are great, but they're not a viable long-term solution for any business. Online will always be able to carry lower costs due to lower overhead and longer times between order and fulfillment. As long as you don't need anything right this second, local online retailers will often give you the option of a next-day delivery, which many customers would happily take.</p>

<p>“It used to be that 80/20 rule — [malls] would be 80% shopping and 20% experience. It’s got to go the opposite now, because all the shopping you can do faster, cheaper, etc., online.” </p>

<p>What customers (users, advocates, or fans) are looking for is an experience that an online store isn't able to provide. They’re looking for entertainment, information, and a unique, personalized experience.</p>

<p>Volvo is releasing their new SUV, the XC40, with a new concept called 
<a href="https://www.volvocars.com/intl/cars/care-by-volvo?ref="antonsten".com">Care by Volvo</a>
 . It's what they describe as "the next step in our journey to redefine how people use cars." Rather than purchasing your car you go online, customize it to your liking, and then hit 'Order'. The car is made to your specifications and then you'll rent it for a monthly fee. The monthly fee includes everything: service, insurances, maintenance, and repairs. If you ever have the need for a larger vehicle, there's even an included discount for rentals! For younger people that don't want to (or can’t) pay a lump sum for a vehicle, this is great option.

<p>Apple, is tapping into a similar concept with their retail stores. Apple Stores historically have performed great - they have </p>

It turns out more customers are turning to Apple.com for their brand new iPhone order. In February 2016, Apple changed direction by removing the word 'store' from it's retail locations.</p>

<p>"It’s funny, we actually don’t call them ‘stores’ anymore. We call them ‘town squares’ because they’re gathering places for 500 million people who visit us every year. </p>
<br>
<br>We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community." </br>

<p>The change we're seeing is very positive, but unfortunately it could mean the extinction of some stores that don’t follow the changing trends. As customers, we will benefit. We will get better, more personalized service at a variety of retail locations. Remember those online giants I mentioned earlier? Soon they are coming to your community and will bring the personal interaction we’ve been missing. Retail is evolving!</p>
