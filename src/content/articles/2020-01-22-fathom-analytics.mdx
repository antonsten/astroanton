>Fathom Analytics exists because we were sick of compromising when it came to website data. We didn’t want to settle for analytics from “big tech” companies who like to make us the product and sell our data. We didn’t want to collect data but have to pour through 100s of pages of reports to interpret it, we wanted quick and easy (which is why our software is ONE page).

I just started using [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZTSEBE) and it's one of the products that you immediately can tell that it's built with love. If you want dead simple analytics that respect your user's privacy - [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZTSEBE) is for you. [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90300072/its-time-to-ditch-google-analytics) listed them as one of the options to ditch Google Analytics which, let's be honest, no one really knows how to use.
