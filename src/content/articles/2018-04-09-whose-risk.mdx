>We cannot be part of a discussion on what risks a certain technology has without asking whose risks. It makes an awful lot of difference. …It’s quite pointless to talk about risk-benefit without saying, “Are those who are at risk also getting the benefits, or are those who are getting the benefits very far removed from risk?”<br /><br />
This is particularly the case if you look at development in the Third World, for example, where women are often in the end more disadvantaged than they were before. The questions to ask are “Whose benefits? Whose risks?” rather than “What benefits? What risks?”**<a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/seven-into-seven/">Seven into seven.</a>**

While this great post by Ethan Marcotte originally discussed the topic of Google AMP, it's just as relevant today regarding Facebook. It's clear now that the users are taking the risk while Facebook themselves are getting the benefits.
