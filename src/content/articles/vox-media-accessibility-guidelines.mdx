title: "Vox Media Accessibility Guidelines"
description: "\n\n\n“Making work accessible creates a better experience across the board. Use this checklist to help build accessibility into your process no matter your role or stage in a project.”\n\n\n\nI love every single bit of this list. It’s a goldmine. I especially love how it goes across the entire team (designers, developers, product manager, q&a and content creators) – it’s everyone’s responsibility – to create accessible content.\n\n\nhttp://accessibility.voxmedia.com\n"
