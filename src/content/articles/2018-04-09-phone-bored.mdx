>Phone boredom occurs when you’re technically “on your phone,” but you’re still bored out of your mind. It’s that feeling when you’re mindlessly clicking around, opening and closing apps, looking for something to do digitally and finding the options uninteresting.<br /><br />Whereas previous generations may have scrolled through channels on the radio, wandered into different rooms in their house, or flicked through countless TV channels, today’s teens say they’ll sometimes open and close up to 20-30 apps, hoping that something, anything, will catch their attention.**<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/generation-z-is-already-bored-by-the-internet">Generation Z Is Already Bored by the Internet</a>**

Although not technically GenZ, I can relate to being phone bored. Wishful thinking would be that my mind is still young, refusing to grow old but <a href="https://om.co/2018/04/04/phone-bored/">Om Malik states a great case</a> to why this might be to due to lack of great apps.
