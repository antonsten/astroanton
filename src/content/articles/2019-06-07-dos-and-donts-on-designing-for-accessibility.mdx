> Karwai Pun is an interaction designer currently working on Service Optimisation to make existing and new services better for our users. Karwai is part of an accessibility group at Home Office Digital, leading on autism. Together with the team, she’s created these dos and don’ts posters as a way of approaching accessibility from a design perspective.**[Dos and dont’s on designing for accessibility](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/)**

It's very rare that I post images on this site but for [these posters](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/) I'll happily make an exception. Karwai Pun, I lift my hat for you. You can even [find them hi-res here](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility).
