>Netflix has to "produce great content, market it well, serve it up beautifully." If not successful in that pursuit, Netflix will be "run over, just like anybody else."**[Reed Hastings - Netflix Earnings call](https://ir.netflix.com/static-files/51df0da1-4b47-4561-9a06-83906ad52932)**

The Netflix saga is one of it's kind and Wall Street seems to love [$NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nflx?p=nflx) - it's up over 70% YTD and more than 400% in just three years. It's refreshing how Reed Hastings (CEO Netflix) puts their task at hand though. It's all about providing content that the users want, market it and serve it up beautifully. Without any of the three, they'll be 'run over'.
