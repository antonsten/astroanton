<p>Hi! </p><p>First things first, I recently merged two lists into one. So, if you unsubscribed and are still getting this—SORRY! Please scroll to the bottom and unsubscribe again. I promise 🖐️ you won’t hear from me again (though I’ll be a bit sad).</p><p>If you’ve forgotten about me, I’m Anton. I’ve been a designer sharing my thoughts on product design for over a decade. I recently gave <a href="https://www.antonsten.com/" rel="noreferrer">my website a facelift,</a> and I think the reading experience is much better now. Feel free to take a look and see if there’s anything you enjoy. Here are three posts that give a good idea of the type of writing I typically share:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.antonsten.com/articles/stakeholder/" rel="noreferrer">The Stakeholder Interview</a></li><li><a href="https://www.antonsten.com/articles/freelancing-three-values/" rel="noreferrer">Freelancing: three values that change everything</a></li><li><a href="https://www.antonsten.com/articles/how-to-sell-design/" rel="noreferrer">How to sell design</a></li></ol><p>I've spent this week running a design sprint in San Francisco. It's been absolutely fantastic and I've been fortunate to talk to a lot of our users. That said, I can't wait to go back home to Anna and Taylor! </p><p>I was recently a guest on the Matters of Creative podcast, where I shared a bit about my journey.<br /><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/matters-of-creative/id1750097456?ref=antonsten.com" rel="noreferrer">Apple Podcasts</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1wUcImVHVIoyhpGO3xr7eW?si=098cb09ba0d94780&ref=antonsten.com" rel="noreferrer">Spotify</a></p><hr /><h3 id="coming-up">Coming up</h3><p>I have two posts planned in the next weeks: </p><ol><li>I've already written a new post about a realization I've had recently when it comes to what I think about tools and this old post of mine; <a href="https://www.antonsten.com/articles/newtools/" rel="noreferrer">New tools don't always equal productivity</a>. Curious? Hold out until next week! </li><li>I'm excited to share a new post on accessibility in a couple of weeks. Rather than pointing fingers, I've taken a more philosophical approach. We all agree that accessibility is crucial... until we start designing 🙃. But what if aspects of accessibility could benefit every user? Stay tuned!</li></ol><hr /><h3 id="links">Links</h3><ol><li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_things_they_carried?ref=antonsten.com" rel="noreferrer">The things they carried</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/technology/jony-ive-apple-lovefrom.html?searchResultPosition=1&ref=antonsten.com" rel="noreferrer">After Apple, Jony Ive Is Building an Empire of His Own</a></li><li><a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/the-startup-designer?ref=antonsten.com" rel="noreferrer">The Startup Designer</a></li></ol><hr />

<div>From aesthetic simplicity (how it looks), to logical simplicity (how it works), all the way to technical simplicity (how it performs)—those layers are intrinsically connected and work together to create a simple experience for users. If your product looks simple but takes long minutes to load, users likely won’t perceive it as simple.<br /><a href="https://www.doc.cc/articles/simplicity?ref=antonsten.com" rel="noreferrer">Simplicity</a></div>
