> &#8220;Making work accessible creates a better experience across the board. Use this checklist to help build accessibility into your process no matter your role or stage in a project.&#8221;

I love every single bit of this list. It&#8217;s a goldmine. I especially love how it goes across the entire team (designers, developers, product manager, q&a and content creators) &#8211; it&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s responsibility &#8211; to create accessible content.
