<p>Hello</p>
<p>How have you been? I'm really enjoying summer, and surprisingly, I'm also loving working full-time. Sure, I miss the thrill of meeting new talented folks every month and tackling fresh challenges.

<p>Those of you who have been reading my stuff for a while know that Iâ€™ve been through quite the journey over the past five years. Shifting from consulting full-time to being a full-time employee has been one of those decisions that was difficult, but has allowed me to reflect on my core values and understand how this was a good choice for who I am today.
