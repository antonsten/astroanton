Just like I outlined in a previous popular post, [&#8220;What&#8217;s the cost of &#8216;sharing&#8217;?&#8221;](/what-is-the-cost-of-sharing/) &#8211; conversions might actually benefit from not having social sharing buttons.

Turns out by a <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/removing-social-sharing-buttons-from-ecommerce-product-page-increase-conversions/?utm_source=intercom&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_content=H4&#038;utm_campaign=nurture" target="_blank">test ran by Visual Website Optimizer</a> that when Taloon removed their social sharing buttons, their add-to-cart increased by nearly 12%.

>&#8220;According to Jani Uusi-Pantti, the number of shares on most of his product pages were zero. While high number of shares and likes act as a positive reinforcement, low number of shares breed distrust in the mind of the customer about both the company and the quality of the product.&#8221;
<br /><br />
People want to share content, not products. Even if you&#8217;re IKEA, Amazon or Target &#8211; you&#8217;re not going to have thousands of people sharing a product. And while it might work for a hugely popular product like an iPhone, it&#8217;s not going to work for the extra USB-cord, the charger or a bumper case.
