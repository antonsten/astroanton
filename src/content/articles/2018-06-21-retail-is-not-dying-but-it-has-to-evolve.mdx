>Looking to the future of retail in general, Ahrendts mentioned numbers from an analytic firm that suggest while the majority of shopping will move online, many customers will still venture out to physical locations to finalize a purchase. This means that shoppers will use apps and online websites to research products and items, and perhaps reserve them for in-store pickup, much like Apple already does today.<br />
_You have your instincts and you use a lot of smart outside guys, and the smart outside guys they don't say retail is dying. They say digital is gonna grow at three times the rate of physical, but in the next five years... 75 percent of people will shop online, shop to learn [about what they want to buy], but 75 percent of business will still be done in physical stores._**<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/20/angela-ahrendts-talks-retail/">Retail is Not Dying, But it Has to Evolve</a>**

Pretty much in line with <a href="/futureofretail/">my thoughts</a> from the beginning of this year.
