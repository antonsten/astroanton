#The book is released! [Get it here!](https://antonsten.com/books/user-experiences-matter/)

I’ve just released something out in the wild that honestly scares me shitless. I’m releasing my first book! It’s titled <a href="/book/" target="_blank">“User Experiences that Matter”</a>.

## Why would I write a book?

I’ve never defined myself as a writer or even a man of many words (you probably already suspect this because of my Finnish roots). However, I’ve found in order to grow as a designer, it’s critical to be able to communicate your thoughts and all the reasoning behind your design decisions. I had set a goal for myself (one newsletter every two weeks) and found that putting my thoughts out there has allowed me to grow in ways I didn’t expect. I began thinking about the challenges to solving practical design problems &#8211; visual design challenges if you will &#8211; and then focused my writing on sharing how I have come to solve these challenges when creating digital products. As my writing evolved, it became obvious that these pieces together would work really well in a book!

## What is User Experiences that Matter about?

The book is an easy-to-understand book that covers the essentials of creating great digital user experiences. It features everything you need to take your product from an idea liked by you to one LOVED by your users.

User Experiences that Matter will teach you everything from what UX design really is (and what it isn’t!) to exactly how you can create the perfect experiences for your products without having to draw those black and white wireframes.

It’s not a magic formula (if you know one, [email me!](mailto:anton@www.antonsten.com)), but rather a guide with processes, assignments, and strategy that I’ve found to work.

## Who is it for?

Do you want to create digital user experiences that not only perform up to your expectations, but make your users fall in love with your product? Do you want to create a product that drives conversion, but stays true to your brand? Do you think the user experience of a product is absolutely essential to success, but don’t know how to get it there? If you’re nodding your head at all then this is the book for you!

This book will help you:

  * Get started in the digital space and grow
  * Understand how UX works and why
  * Build the next great digital product
  * Learn there is still room to improve as a senior designer

## Do we need a book about user experiences?

While there are tons of great resources out there that cover everything from psychological, philosophical, economic, and practical aspects of UX design, I’ve yet to find a book that covers the basics of creating great digital experiences.

For example, the first iPhone was launched without an AppStore. Mind blowing, I know. Our first experience with this product was with it’s core functionality. A lot of products we see released today would benefit from starting more basic and really think about how they’ll provide their users with a great experience. However, many developers make the mistake of equating more features with making the product more successful. Often it just makes it more difficult for new users to understand the basics of the product and hurts conversion.

I’ve geared the book towards helping designers/developers/product manager/companies adjust how they view their users and craft amazing experiences with their product. After all, isn’t what the user feels about the product just as important as what they do with it? Some label this as branding, but let’s be honest, that’s just one piece of the entire user experience cake. Big picture thinking like that creates strong products.

I am eager to share my experiences with all of you. I have made mistakes, grown as a designer, and taken the time to organize how I overcame challenges in a way that can be presented to you. I hope this book serves you all and help you to find amazing success creating brilliant user experiences!
