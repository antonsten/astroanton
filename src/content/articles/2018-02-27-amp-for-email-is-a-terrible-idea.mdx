>Google just announced a plan to “modernize” email with its Accelerated Mobile Pages platform, allowing “engaging, interactive, and actionable email experiences.” Does that sound like a terrible idea to anyone else? It sure sounds like a terrible idea to me, and not only that, but an idea borne out of competitive pressure and existing leverage rather than user needs. Not good, Google. Send to trash.<br /><br />See, email belongs to a special class. Nobody really likes it, but it’s the way nobody really likes sidewalks, or electrical outlets, or forks. It not that there’s something wrong with them. It’s that they’re mature, useful items that do exactly what they need to do. **[AMP for email is a terrible idea](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/amp-for-email-is-a-terrible-idea/)**

I'm a big fan of email and the protocol and I can't think of anything worse than Google force pressing their technology on the one thing of the web that still feels <i>'open'</i>. Makes me think of this old post; [Stop Saying Email is Broken](/emailbroken).
