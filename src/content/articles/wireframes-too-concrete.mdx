I’ll give a wireframe to my designer, and then I’m saying to her: “I know you’re looking at this, but that’s not what I want you to design. I want you to re-think it!” It’s hard to do that when you’re giving them this concrete thing.<strong><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02?ref=antonsten.com#wireframes-are-too-concrete">Wireframes are too concrete</a></strong></p></div>
