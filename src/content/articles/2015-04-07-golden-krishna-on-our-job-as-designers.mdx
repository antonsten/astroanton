> I believe our job as designers is to give you what you need as quickly and as elegantly as we can. Our job as designers is to take you away from technology. Our job as designers is to make you smile. To make a profit by providing you something that enhances your life in the most seamless and wonderful way possible.

Love this quote from <a href="http://www.goldenkrishna.com" target="_blank">Golden Krishna</a> in his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Interface-No-brilliant-technology/dp/0133890333/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428411473&sr=8-1&keywords=the+best+interface+is+no+interface" target="_blank">The best interface is no interface</a>. If you haven&#8217;t read the book, I strongly advice you to (even if you&#8217;re not a UX-designer). Get an idea of it&#8217;s content by watching his talk from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://videos.theconference.se/golden-krishna-communication-without-a" target="_blank">The Conference</a>.
