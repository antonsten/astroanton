>I believe freelancing is the ultimate way to take control of my life, my finances and my daily happiness. I don't freelance as an interim step until I build a huge company. This is a long-term, long-lasting career that's now more stable than any corporate job. I freelance because I love being a freelancer. <br /><br />It gives me the ability to chart my own path in life, not to mention working in my underwear (with my clients being none-the-wiser). I choose who I work with, when I work, and most importantly, when I don't need to work.**Paul Jarvis <a href="https://creativeclass.co/ref/50/">pjrvs.com</a>**

One of the freelancers I always seem to quote is Paul Jarvis. He has the gift to create his own amazing products and the determination to follow through. I've had the opportunity to talk to Paul on several occasions and he's a genuinely nice guy (and we share the same <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BY_F0u_hGEl/?taken-by=antonsten">love of cars</a>).You may know Paul's name from <a href="/books">my books</a> as I've interviewed him for both of my books or from the great ChimpEssentials.

I'm excited that this week Paul together with Kaleigh - another freelance superstar, are relaunching their Creative Class. This is by far one of the <a href="https://creativeclass.co/ref/50/">best online classes</a> I've ever purchased. **Because Paul and Kaleigh are such nice people, they'll give you $20 off if you use the code 'ANTONSE' when signing up.** <a href="https://creativeclass.co/ref/50/">Sign up here.</a>
