A couple of weeks ago I sent a small survey to selected clients. I wanted a quick and easy way for them to be able to tell me what they think of working with me and the work I deliver. Each client could leave a comment and decide if they wanted to leave their name or not.

There was one specific comment that made me extra happy. It&#8217;s short, just two sentences but it captures so much of what I think is important when working with me.

Are you ready for it? Here goes:

> &#8220;What impresses me most is the way Anton understand the underlying needs of the business, and translates that into a beautiful solution. Anton is very easy to work with and he is good at finding the balance between listening and pushing.&#8221;

If we break it down, here&#8217;s what I love about it:

As a designer, my job is not to create pretty things. My job is to understand the underlying business needs and translate these into a well-crafted solution. This involves understanding the client and their business as well as it involves understanding their end users and their needs. The client in question is the world&#8217;s largest electricity supplier (<a href="http://www.eon.com/en.html" target="_blank">E.ON</a>) and I&#8217;m helping them with an online tool for their largest corporate clients. Needless to say, I am not part of their target audience. But as a UX-designer, it&#8217;s my job to understand how someone who&#8217;s a site operator thinks. It&#8217;s my job to understand and develop the features an accountant will need.

Working with, especially, large corporations is very different from working with smaller start-ups. The pace and the time it takes to get things implemented is very different. It&#8217;s essential to understand the possibilities as well as the limitations of any client that you work with. And most of all, it&#8217;s important to understand when to push and when to pull back.

Creating an online experience is not a sprint, it&#8217;s like so much else, a marathon. And as a designer, I need to be able to know my body well enough to know when to push and when to slow down and just enjoy the scenery.
