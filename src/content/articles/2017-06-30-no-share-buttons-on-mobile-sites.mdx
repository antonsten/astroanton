> Only 2 out of every 1000 mobile web users ever tap a custom share button—like even once—according to a Moovweb study. We found similarly tiny numbers during our research designing Philly.com and verticals for About.com. That means people are over 11 times more likely to tap a mobile advertisement than a mobile share button for Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.

Excellent piece by <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/no-mobile-share-buttons.html" target="_blank">Josh Clark over at Bigmedium</a> on share buttons on mobile sites.
