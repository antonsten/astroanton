>Itâ€™s easy to get into a heated discussion about frameworks, what type of class names make the most sense, which optimization techniques are most important, or what part of your code base is should be responsible for styling. Those are great discussions that guide our industry.<br /><br />But what is more important? The naming convention you chose or if your user can actually book a flight? Which state store library you picked or if you actually had the scarf your user was looking for? Which command line tool pulled your dependencies or whether someone was able to find and read the instructions to send in their court appeal?<br /><br />

This is something I can relate to from several projects. Some projects even begin by discussing tools and frame works rather than the desired outcomes! Especially e-commerce sites seem to focus on what system should be used rather than what the outcomes of the redesign should be. Increased sales is fine but it's not a metric that's as defined as it should be.
