    <p class="body-lg mb-12">I've been a younger brother for 44 years, loved dogs for 40, been into music for 35, worked as a designer for 28, supported Liverpool for 26, and called Sweden home for 23 years.</p>

    <p class="body-lg mb-12">It's amusing to look at life through these timestamps—it might seem like the last two decades were uneventful, when actually, they've contained my entire adult life and career.</p>
      
    <p class="body-lg mb-20">When I'm not designing, I love being outdoors with my wife Anna and our dog Taylor (Swift). We live in an old, beautiful house that comes with a never-ending list of repairs—which I've grown to enjoy more and more, accepting that it's a perpetual journey.</p>
