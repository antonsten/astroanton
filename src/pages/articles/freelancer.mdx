It might be because they heard that they should stop calling themselves "freelancers" and start calling themselves "consultants", and assumed it was merely a semantic difference.<br>
<br><br>
A freelancer is a mercenary.<br>
<br><br>
A consultant is an advisor.<br>
<br><br>
Mercenaries do as they're told.<br>
<br><br>
Advisors answer questions when asked.<br>
