<p>I normally don't write about my second big passion in life, Liverpool, here but I'll make an exception because of the amazing come back against Barcelona last Tuesday. I watched the second leg of the game in a hotel room in France. I was almost ready to tell my wife that we might as well go out to dinner, that there's no way they'll come back from a 3-0 defeat. But they did and it was one of the best Liverpool experiences I've had in a long time (anyone familiar with the club know that the last years have had their... downs).</p>
