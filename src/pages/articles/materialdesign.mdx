The question posed in that meeting (Why don’t we just use Material Design?) reverses the design process in a way that epitomizes the problem with any design system. The question that should have been asked was: “Would employing Material Design solve some, or all, of our problems?”<br>

There’s an assumption that Material Design, as published by Google, is a magic bullet that addresses most, if not all, challenges in modern web design. I think that assumption probably stems from the fact that the Material Design specification is well written, and feels authoritative. I also think that assumption is false.<strong><a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2019/04/why-dont-we-just-use-material-design/?ref=antonsten.com">Why don’t we just use Material Design?</a></strong></p></div>

<p>I've heard this same question in countless meetings and even received it as a request from clients (<em>We want you to use Material Design</em>). It's true that it's a solid design system, but when even Google struggles to implement it successfully through out their suite of products, perhaps be a bit empathic to wether or not it'll solve all of your design challenges.</p>
