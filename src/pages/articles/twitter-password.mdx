<p>Pre-context: Twitter admitted they had found a bug that showed all passwords in plain text rather than masked and encrypted. Their CTO Parag Agrawal commented:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<div><p>We are sharing this information to help people make an informed decision about their account security. We didn’t have to, but believe it’s the right thing to do.<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/992135139994943488?s=21&ref=antonsten.com">Parag Agrawal</a></strong></p></div>
</div>

<p>Just the mention of <em>"didn't have to"</em> makes you question their views on integrity and privacy. I'm interested in how the GDPR would view this scenario as there technically isn't a breach (under the GDPR, the company is legally obliged to notify users within 72 hours), it's a breach waiting to happen. It's like the bank left all of their customers money in the lobby.</p>
