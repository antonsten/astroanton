<p>Here’s what ChatGPT is telling me creativity is:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div>“Creativity is the ability to come up with new and original ideas. It's about thinking outside the box, seeing things from different perspectives, and combining existing concepts in innovative ways. Whether it's art, problem-solving, or everyday tasks, creativity involves using your imagination to create something unique and valuable.”<br><em>ChatGPT response to “What is creativity?” prompt</em></div>
</div>
<p>As for someone that’s spent a large portion of my career working on B2B tools for large corporations like e.On and IKEA, I’ve come to reconsider what I think creativity and being innovative entails. In fact, I’d argue that it's some of the things we hardly notice because they just work. They the true innovations of design. The thing when designing - especially B2B tools in particular - is that there are so many guardrails and constraints to consider. This is where true creativity shines! Rather than thinking of designing within constraints as a boundary, I think we should embrace it.</p><p>Nadia mentions that she feels that her designs are both well-functioning and well-received, but that she doesn’t sense innovation in them. I’d argue that well-functioning and well-received is exactly what the job requirement of a designer is. As for no sense of innovation, I want to urge anyone feeling the same way as Nadia to reflect on what they consider ‘innovative design’. I believe innovation is, in the eye of the beholder. It’s taste. It’s preference. Well-functioning and well-received designs are facts. They are justified. They are measurable. <strong>Comparing the two isn’t fair, because they operate on different scales.</strong></p><p>Innovation to me is all about reducing friction and making things operate more effortless. Even looking at a specific feature, let’s say FaceID, innovation can mean so much to different people. For some it might be the feature itself, to be able to unlock your phone simply by looking at it. For others it might be the fact that the camera is hidden inside the notch. For some, it might be the authentication process itself. And for others, it could be how the animation transforms from a face to a checkbox, an innovation that most people will never even consider. There are SO many facets to this innovation.</p><p>So Nadia, my advice to you is to reflect on what kind of design you consider to be innovative and why. Once you’ve nailed that down, you can then either seek out to implement more of that thinking and innovation in your work or you can simply be inspired by it. There is no harm either way. What you WILL be doing is continuing to create well-functioning and well-received designs - a big plus. In the end, you are creating and that results in creative work!</p>
