<div><p>“In 2019, it’s time to stand up for the right to privacy—yours, mine, all of ours. Consumers shouldn’t have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives.<br>
<br><br><br>
This problem is solvable—it isn’t too big, too challenging or too late. Innovation, breakthrough ideas and great features can go hand in hand with user privacy—and they must. Realizing technology’s potential depends on it.<br>
<br><br><br>
That’s why I and others are calling on the U.S. Congress to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation—a landmark package of reforms that protect and empower the consumer. Last year, before a global body of privacy regulators, I laid out four principles that I believe should guide legislation:<br>
<br><br><br>
First, the right to have personal data minimized. Companies should challenge themselves to strip identifying information from customer data or avoid collecting it in the first place. Second, the right to knowledge—to know what data is being collected and why. Third, the right to access. Companies should make it easy for you to access, correct and delete your personal data. And fourth, the right to data security, without which trust is impossible.”<strong><a href="http://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502591/tim-cook-data-privacy/?ref=antonsten.com">Tim Cook: You Deserve Privacy Online. Here's How You Could Actually Get It</a></strong></p></div>

<p>Finally, Cook calls for the <em>"power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily, and online, once and for all."</em> It's interesting how technically easy (well, sort of) this would actually be and how obvious it sounds that, yeah of course this is how it should be. Yet it's unlikely that it's a world we'll ever live in.</p>
