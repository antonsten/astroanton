description: "\n\n\nWhen calm starts early, calm becomes the habit. But if you start crazy, it'll define you. You have to keep asking yourself if the way you're working today is the way you'd want to work in 10, 20, or 30 years. If not, now is the time to make a change, not \"later\". Calm\n\n\n\nI have two post its on my screen in my office. One says \"It's not personal\" and the other one says \"Be Polite & Be Fair\". I'm thinking the third one should say \"Is this how I want to work\".\n"
