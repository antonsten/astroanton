See, when you’re a freelancer, you don’t have to set daily goals. You have the luxury of setting weekly goals because you control your schedule.

You have the ability to lean into the rest of your life, on your time, unlike “full-time” workers.<strong><a href="https://medium.com/@Arestia/my-1-piece-of-advice-to-freelancers-lean-into-the-moment-ed7e4195fa05?ref=antonsten.com">My #1 Piece of Advice to Freelancers: Lean Into The Moment</a></strong></p></div>
