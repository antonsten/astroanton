<p>This is a great variation of what I was aiming for in <a href="https://www.antonsten.com/newtools/">'New Tools Don't Always Equal Productivity'</a>. Frank, one of my favorite designers/writers, really hits the head of the nail here. Whenever I'm stressed out or can't seem to be able to do good work I occasionally believe it's because I don't have a great to-do list app or missing a Sketch plugin. Most of the time, a workout, a Headspace session, a walk with my dog or a good meal takes care of it. We should learn to turn to these things more often.</p>
