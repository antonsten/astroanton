<p>Great notes from <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1980=&ref=antonsten.com">Luke W</a> from Andrey Lipattsev's talk Checkout for Winners.</p>
<p>Bullet points that stuck out to me:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<div><ul>
<li>The Web is better than ever before. You can build fast, rich, app-like experiences but many companies opt to route people to native experiences instead of optimizing the Web experiences. That needs to change.</li>
</ul></div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>On mobile, 54% of people quit checkout if they are asked to sign-up. 92% will give up if they don't remember a password or user name.</li>
<li>AliExpress had a 41% higher sign-in rate, 85% fewer sign-in failures, and 11% better conversion rate when they added One tap.</li>
<li>The Guardian gained 44% more cross-platform signed-in users with One tap.</li>
<li>We still buy things online by filling in Web forms. This introduces a lot of friction at a critical point.</li>
<li>2-5minutes is the average for checkout times on the Web. The PaymentRequest API reduces this effort to 30seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducing friction is critical in every user experience and interaction. I'm delighted everytime I need to sign into an app or a page and I see the small 1Password icon in the signup fields. Anything that's reducing the boring tasks (like manually entering data into fields) makes for a better experience.</p>
<p>Reducing checkout time from 2-5 minutes to 30 seconds is insane and there's no wonder that the conversions are up. If anything, I'm surprised they're not up by more.</p>
